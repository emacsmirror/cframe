Allows for customization of frame types, which includes height and width of new
Emacs frames.  Options included are all of those which are included from
`make-frame`.  This is handy for those that rather resize your Emacs frames
with a key binding rather than using your mouse.


## Usage

This library *learns* frame positions with `M-x cframe-add-or-advance-setting`
and then cycles through configuratinos with `cframe-add-or-advance-setting`.
You can pull up the [entries buffer] with `cframe-list`.


## Changelog

An extensive changelog is available [here](CHANGELOG.md).
