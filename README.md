Allows for customization of Emacs frames, which include height and width of
new Emacs frames.  Options for new frames are those given to `make-frame`.
This is handy for those that rather resize your Emacs frames with a key binding
than using your mouse.


## Usage

This library uses much of the functinality of
the
[config-manage](https://github.com/plandes/buffer-manage/blob/master/config-manage.el) library.
It "learns" frame configurations, then restores them later on:

* Record frame positions with `M-x cframe-add-or-advance-setting`.
* Restore previous settings on start up with `cframe-restore`.
* Cycles through configuratinos with `cframe-add-or-advance-setting`.
* Pull up the [entries buffer] with `cframe-list`.

I use the following in my `~/.emacs` configuration file:
```elisp
(require 'cframe)

;; frame size settings based on screen dimentions
(global-set-key "\C-x9" 'cframe-restore)

;; doesn't clobber anything in shell, emacs lisp buffers (maybe others?)
(global-set-key "\C-\\" 'cframe-add-or-advance-setting)
```
