Allows for customization of frame types, which includes height and width of new
Emacs frames.  Options included are all of those which are included from
`make-frame`.  This is handy for those that rather resize your Emacs frames
with a key binding than using your mouse.


## Usage

This library uses much of the functinality of
the
[config-manage](https://github.com/plandes/buffer-manage/blob/master/config-manage.el) library.
It *learns* frame configurations, then restores them later on:

* Record frame positions with `M-x cframe-add-or-advance-setting`.
* Restore previous settings on start up with `cframe-restore`.
* Cycles through configuratinos with `cframe-add-or-advance-setting`.
* Pull up the [entries buffer] with `cframe-list`.

I use the following in my `~/.emacs` configuration file:
```elisp
(require 'frame-customize)

;; frame size settings based on screen dimentions
(global-set-key "\C-x9" 'cframe-restore)

;; doesn't clobber anything in shell, emacs lisp buffers (maybe others?)
(global-set-key "\C-\\" 'cframe-add-or-advance-setting)
```
